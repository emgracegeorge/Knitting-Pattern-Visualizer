# Introduction

This is a tool to visualize how colors will look in a finished woven scarf. Currently it is programmed to match the Selvedge scarf pattern by Julia Wilkins [https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/selvedge]. The user inputs the RGB values they plan to use based on the pattern, and the DrawingPanel will show an image of what the scarf will look like.

# Next Steps

This project was initially done to help me pick the colors I would use when knitting the Selvedge pattern. The goal is to eventually adapt this to be able to visualize any woven pattern and to be interactive to user input. Currently I am developing an interface using React so that colors can be selected from a color wheel and the impacts can be seen simultaneously.
